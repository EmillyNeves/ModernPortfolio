Enhanced Gaming & Programming RPG Interface

I'll update the design to have a stronger gaming and programming aesthetic with RPG elements and speech bubbles, similar to the references you provided.
Enhanced Gaming & Programming RPG Interface

I've completely redesigned the interface to have a stronger gaming and RPG aesthetic, incorporating elements from your references and adding speech bubbles. The new design features:
RPG Game Elements

    Character Stats System
        RPG-style attributes (Intelligence, Logic, Memory, Energy)
        Level progression with XP tracking
        Character class (DEV MAGE) with special abilities
        Status effects that impact performance

    Gaming Visual Elements
        Speech bubbles for tips and information
        Quest tracking with progress bars
        Achievement badges and rewards
        XP gain indicators on completed activities

    Programming Theme
        Terminal-inspired interface elements
        Code-like naming conventions (MAIN_TERMINAL, VIEW_ALL_MISSIONS())
        Tech icons representing different skills and abilities
        Programming class specializations

Key Features

    Dashboard/Main Terminal
        Character stats card with RPG attributes
        Quest tracking with XP rewards
        Weekly schedule grid with XP indicators
        Experience progress tracking
        Speech bubble system messages

    Character Stats Page
        Detailed character profile with level and class
        Full RPG attribute breakdown
        Status effects with time remaining
        Class specializations and skill proficiencies
        Ranking system comparing to other students

The interface now feels much more like a game, with the academic tracking elements presented as quests, missions, and character progression. The speech bubbles add a conversational element that makes the interface more engaging and interactive.
